<h1>Debater</h1>

<h2>Assignment 1: Pet Projects</h2>

<ol>
<li>Capstone Ideas

<ol>
<li><strong>Debater</strong>. An app that provides a structured, game-like way for people to engage in debates of all kinds. Channel the energy and fury of pointless arguing on social media into a logic-driven, productive forum with clear rules of engagement for point scoring.</li>
<li><strong>ADHDchat</strong>. An instant message/chat application that allows users to split off conversations into new chat streams or branches, and then invite others into these chat streams. Clarify muddled text, chat and email threads, and table off-topic/out of scope exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>HabitMaker</strong>. Create, schedule and track daily goals so as to create positive habits, as inspired by &#8216;The Power of Habit&#8217; and &#8216;The Power of Full Engagement&#8217; self-help books. Design a goal, create the steps to achieve it, and design daily, weekly and monthly checklists and reminders, and view ongoing tracking information and</li>
<li><strong>Mori</strong>. Enter in your age and some lifestyle habits and receive periodic reminders of your mortality based upon actuarial tables. Make your impending death fun!</li>
<li><strong>BCCtext</strong> Service for sending blind copy SMS messages via Twilio. Send out texts sequentially avoiding the insanity of group SMS chats.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Capstone Idea Estimates

<ol>
<li><strong>Debater</strong> I think I could finish a rough, simplied version of the capstone in 1 week (it is sort of a glorified reddit clone, at least at first) and then spend another week adding in some user features to differentiate it.</li>
<li><strong>ADHDchat</strong> This project probably requires me learn JavaScript to be fun at all. I would estimate 1 week to get a chat in rails going and then 1&#8211;2 weeks to learn enough JavaScript to make this passably fun to use.</li>
<li><strong>HabitMaker</strong> I could probably make this in two weeks. It is essentially a modified to do list app. I am not sure how to create data visualization and reports so that could be a real investment of time.</li>
<li><strong>Mori</strong> Email or SMS notifications are both mostly unknown to me and my brief exposure to Rails&#8217; Mailer proved time consuming. I would guess 2 weeks to complete a basic app. I think I would make a very simple lifespan calculator to start.</li>
<li><strong>BCCtext</strong> I think a bare bones version of this app would take me 3 weeks. I have looked at <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2012/02/adding-twilio-sms-messaging-to-your-rails-app.html">Twilio</a> for SMS-to-Rails integration and it looks user friendly enough, but then there are the issues of create a user model, allowing users to make an address book, and then figuring out how I can sequentially text from that book.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Double estimates

<ol>
<li><strong>Debater</strong> 2 =&gt; 4 weeks</li>
<li><strong>ADHDchat</strong> 2.5 =&gt; 5 weeks</li>
<li><strong>HabitMaker</strong> 2 =&gt; 4 weeks</li>
<li><strong>Mori</strong> 2 =&gt; 4 weeks</li>
<li><strong>BCCtext</strong> 3 =&gt; 6 weeks</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Favorite ideas and more explanation of what I am going for.

<ol>
<li>I want to do the Debater app</li>
<li>I would like to be able to combine the text analysis of Genius (formerly Rap Genius) with something between a <a href="http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudPage.html">Talmudic commentary</a> and high school speech and debate note taking (called &#8220;<a href="http://paradigmpride.tripod.com/tutorials/ld-flowing.htm">flowing</a>&#8221;).</li>
<li>I think there is a general dissatisfaction with political discourse and with social media as a venue for civic engagement and politics - this zeitgeist plus the looming election make the timing fortuitious.</li>
<li>There is an amusing Facebook account <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fallacyref">FallacyRef</a> that inspired the idea of using formal logical fallacies (it is now an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fallacy-ref/id1046994022?ls=1&amp;mt=8">app</a>) in order to debate in a more structured way.</li>
<li>Lastly I really liked the <a href="http://www.codewars.com/">codewars</a> kata system and thought that somehow a gamified debate would be more fun. Maybe there is a way to ease people into the structure via games and points before engaging people who are already experienced as a form of tutorial.</li>
