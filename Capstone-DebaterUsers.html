<h1>Debater</h1>

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

<h3>User Stories</h3>

<p>Concept: &quot;As a <em>user type</em>, I want to <em>action</em> so I can <em>reason</em></p>

<p>Below I have created a series of what might be called Marketing Profiles or Customer Persona if I was running an ad campaign.</p>

<p>Each item has 3 sub items. 1st is technical requirements, the 2nd is difficulty, 3rd is time estimate in hours. Difficulty is rated from 1&#8211;10 , 10 being hardest. A &#8216;?&#8217; signifies the presence of Rumsfeldian &#8220;unknown unknowns&#8221; (ex: 5?)</p>

<ol>

<li>As a <strong>casual</strong> I want to be able to quickly get up to speed on debates and join debates once in a while so I can contribute my opinion.

 3. 24 hours and it would be ugly</li>
